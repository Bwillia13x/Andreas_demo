## Deployment Commands

### Quick Start Deployment
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables
export ADMIN_TOKEN="your-secure-admin-token-here"
export SESSION_SECRET="your-64-character-session-secret"

# 2. Run deployment script
./deploy-production.sh

# 3. Verify deployment
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/services
```

### Manual Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# 2. Build application
npm run build

# 3. Start production server
NODE_ENV=production ADMIN_TOKEN="your-token" SESSION_SECRET="your-secret" npm start
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Check Verification
```bash
# Should return: {"status": "ok", ...}
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Authentication Verification
```bash
# Should return: 401 Unauthorized
curl http://localhost:5000/api/services

# Should return: 200 OK with data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/services
```

### Security Verification
```bash
# Should return: 400 Bad Request (XSS blocked)
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/health?test=<script>alert('xss')</script>"

# Should return: 401 Unauthorized (SQL injection blocked)
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/services?test=1' OR '1'='1"
```

### Performance Verification
```bash
# Load test with 10 concurrent users for 30 seconds
# Should show <5% error rate and <500ms response time
npm run test:functional
```

## Monitoring Dashboard

### Key Metrics to Monitor
```bash
# System Health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .system

# Memory Usage
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .system.memory.utilization

# Database Connections
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .system.database

# Request Throttling
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .system.throttling

# Load Balancer
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .system.loadBalancer
```

### Alert Thresholds
- **Error Rate**: >5% requires investigation
- **Response Time**: >500ms requires optimization
- **Memory Usage**: >80% requires scaling
- **Database Pool**: >90% utilization requires connection increase
- **Circuit Breaker**: Open state requires service restart

## Business Function Verification

### Core Modules Testing
```bash
# Services Management
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/services

# Staff Management
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/staff

# Appointment System
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/appointments

# POS Operations
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/pos/sales

# Inventory Management
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/inventory

# Marketing Campaigns
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/marketing/campaigns

# Business Analytics
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/analytics

# Loyalty Program
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" http://localhost:5000/api/loyalty/entries
```

## Success Criteria

### ‚úÖ All Systems Go
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status": "ok"}`
- [ ] Authentication works for all protected endpoints
- [ ] Load test shows <5% error rate
- [ ] Response times <500ms average
- [ ] All business modules functional

# Manual restart
pkill -f "node dist/index.js"
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

### Security Incident Response
```bash
# 1. Rotate admin token
export ADMIN_TOKEN="new-secure-token-$(date +%s)"

# 2. Update environment
# Update .env file with new ADMIN_TOKEN

# 3. Restart service
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml restart

# 4. Monitor for suspicious activity
docker logs mgmt-vibe-production | grep -i "attack\|bypass\|injection"
```

### Performance Degradation Response
```bash
# 1. Check system health
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health | jq .

# 2. Monitor resource usage
docker stats mgmt-vibe-production

# 3. Check application logs
docker logs --tail 100 mgmt-vibe-production

# 4. Scale if necessary
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --scale mgmt-vibe-production=2
```
