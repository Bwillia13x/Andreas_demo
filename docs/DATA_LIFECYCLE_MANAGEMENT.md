  created_at,
  last_login_at,
  -- No PII in analytics views
FROM users
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## Data Quality Management

### Data Validation Rules
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation of data entry
- **Business Rules**: Automated checks for business logic compliance
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure data consistency across systems

### Data Quality Monitoring
```sql
-- Monitor data quality metrics
SELECT
  'duplicate_emails' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as value
FROM (
  SELECT email, COUNT(*)
  FROM users
  WHERE email IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY email
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) duplicates

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'incomplete_profiles' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as value
FROM users
WHERE name IS NULL OR email IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'orphaned_appointments' as metric,
  COUNT(*) as value
FROM appointments a
LEFT JOIN users u ON a.customer_id = u.id
WHERE u.id IS NULL;
```

## Incident Response Data Handling

2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact of breached data
3. **Notification**: Notify affected individuals and authorities within required timelines
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and validate data integrity
5. **Prevention**: Implement additional security measures

### Data Recovery Validation
```bash
# Validate backup integrity
pg_restore --list backup_file.sql > /dev/null

# Check data consistency
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    n_tup_ins,
    n_tup_upd,
    n_tup_del
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables
  ORDER BY n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del DESC
  LIMIT 10;
"

# Verify referential integrity
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
  SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_records
  FROM appointments a
  LEFT JOIN users u ON a.customer_id = u.id
  WHERE u.id IS NULL;
"
```

    ELSE 'FAIL'
  END as status,
  COUNT(*) as violations,
  'No data older than retention period found' as description
FROM users
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 years'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL

UNION ALL

SELECT
  'data_deletion_compliance' as check_name,
  CASE
    WHEN COUNT(*) = 0 THEN 'PASS'
    ELSE 'FAIL'
  END as status,
  COUNT(*) as violations,
  'All deleted data properly anonymized' as description
FROM users
WHERE deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND deletion_confirmed = true
  AND (email NOT LIKE 'deleted-%' OR phone IS NOT NULL);
```
