# Disaster Recovery Validation

## Overview
This document outlines the procedures for validating disaster recovery capabilities, including backup restoration, failover testing, and business continuity validation for the mgmt-vibe platform.

## Recovery Objectives

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
- **Critical Systems**: < 4 hours
- **Core Business Functions**: < 8 hours
- **Full System Recovery**: < 24 hours

### Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
- **Transaction Data**: < 5 minutes data loss
- **User Data**: < 1 hour data loss
- **Configuration Data**: < 1 hour data loss

## Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario Classification

#### Critical (RTO < 4 hours)
- **Complete Data Center Failure**: Entire primary region unavailable
- **Database Corruption**: Critical database corruption or deletion
- **Security Breach**: Compromised systems requiring complete rebuild
- **Natural Disaster**: Physical infrastructure damage

#### High Priority (RTO < 8 hours)
- **Partial System Failure**: Major components unavailable
- **Network Outage**: Loss of connectivity to critical services
- **Storage Failure**: Primary storage system failure
- **Application Deployment Failure**: Failed deployment affecting production

#### Medium Priority (RTO < 24 hours)
- **Single Component Failure**: Non-critical system component failure
- **Performance Degradation**: System performance below acceptable levels
- **Data Corruption**: Non-critical data corruption
- **Configuration Error**: Misconfiguration affecting operations

## Backup Validation Procedures

### Database Backup Validation

#### Logical Backup Testing
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test database backup restoration

BACKUP_FILE="backup-test-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).sql"
TEST_DB="mgmt_vibe_test_restore"

echo "Starting database backup validation..."

# Create test backup
echo "Creating test backup..."
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" > "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Verify backup file
echo "Verifying backup file..."
if [[ ! -s "$BACKUP_FILE" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: Backup file is empty"
    exit 1
fi

# Create test database
echo "Creating test database..."
createdb "$TEST_DB"

# Restore backup to test database
echo "Restoring backup to test database..."
psql "$TEST_DB" < "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Verify restoration
echo "Verifying restoration..."
TABLE_COUNT=$(psql "$TEST_DB" -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';" | xargs)
echo "Restored $TABLE_COUNT tables"

# Check data integrity
echo "Checking data integrity..."
USER_COUNT=$(psql "$TEST_DB" -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;" | xargs)
APPOINTMENT_COUNT=$(psql "$TEST_DB" -t -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM appointments;" | xargs)

echo "Users: $USER_COUNT, Appointments: $APPOINTMENT_COUNT"

# Clean up
echo "Cleaning up test database..."
dropdb "$TEST_DB"
rm "$BACKUP_FILE"

echo "Database backup validation completed successfully"
```

#### Point-in-Time Recovery Testing
```sql
-- Test point-in-time recovery
-- This requires WAL archiving enabled

-- Create a test scenario
CREATE TABLE disaster_test (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

INSERT INTO disaster_test (data) VALUES ('Test data 1');
SELECT pg_sleep(1);

-- Simulate disaster (don't run in production!)
-- DROP TABLE disaster_test;

-- Get transaction ID at specific point
SELECT txid_current();

-- Recovery to specific transaction
-- In recovery.conf:
-- recovery_target_xid = '12345'
-- recovery_target_action = 'promote'
```

### Application Backup Validation

#### Configuration Backup Testing
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test configuration backup restoration

echo "Testing configuration backup restoration..."

# Backup current configuration
tar -czf config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
    docker-compose.yml \
    nginx.conf \
    k8s/ \
    .env.production.example

# Verify backup integrity
tar -tzf config-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz > /dev/null

echo "Configuration backup validation completed"
```

#### File Storage Backup Testing
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test file storage backup restoration

echo "Testing file storage backup..."

# For cloud storage (AWS S3 example)
aws s3 ls s3://mgmt-vibe-uploads/ | head -10

# Test backup restoration
aws s3 cp s3://mgmt-vibe-backups/latest-files.tar.gz .
tar -tzf latest-files.tar.gz > /dev/null

# Verify file integrity (checksum comparison)
echo "File storage backup validation completed"
```

## Failover Testing

### Database Failover Testing

#### Primary-Replica Failover
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test database failover from primary to replica

echo "Testing database failover..."

# Check current primary
PRIMARY_HOST=$(psql "$DATABASE_URL" -t -c "SELECT inet_server_addr();")

echo "Current primary: $PRIMARY_HOST"

# Simulate primary failure (in test environment)
# In production, this would be handled by your database HA solution

# Promote replica to primary
# pg_ctl promote /path/to/replica/data

# Update application configuration
# sed -i "s/$PRIMARY_HOST/$REPLICA_HOST/g" .env

# Restart application
# docker-compose restart app

# Verify failover
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"

echo "Database failover test completed"
```

#### Cross-Region Failover
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test cross-region database failover

echo "Testing cross-region failover..."

# Check current region
CURRENT_REGION=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/region)

# Simulate region failure
# Route53 weighted routing or global load balancer failover

# Verify cross-region connectivity
psql "$DR_DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"

# Update DNS/application configuration
# aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id $HOSTED_ZONE_ID ...

echo "Cross-region failover test completed"
```

### Application Failover Testing

#### Blue-Green Deployment Testing
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test blue-green deployment failover

echo "Testing blue-green deployment..."

# Deploy to green environment
kubectl apply -f k8s/green-deployment.yml

# Wait for green environment to be ready
kubectl wait --for=condition=available --timeout=300s deployment/mgmt-vibe-green

# Run smoke tests on green environment
curl -f http://green-service/api/health

# Switch traffic to green
kubectl patch service mgmt-vibe-service -p '{
  "spec": {
    "selector": {
      "environment": "green"
    }
  }
}'

# Monitor for issues
sleep 300

# Verify no errors in green environment
kubectl logs deployment/mgmt-vibe-green | grep -i error | wc -l

# Rollback if needed
kubectl patch service mgmt-vibe-service -p '{
  "spec": {
    "selector": {
      "environment": "blue"
    }
  }
}'

echo "Blue-green deployment test completed"
```

    echo "ERROR: Backup is older than 24 hours"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Backup monitoring validation passed"
```

### Recovery Time Validation
```bash
#!/bin/bash
