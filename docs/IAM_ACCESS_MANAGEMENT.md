# IAM and Access Management

## Overview
This document outlines the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, role-based access controls, and procedures for maintaining security and compliance in the mgmt-vibe platform.

## Access Control Principles

### Least Privilege
- Users receive minimum permissions required for their job functions
- Permissions are regularly reviewed and revoked when no longer needed
- Access is granted on a case-by-case basis with business justification

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Access is assigned based on job roles and responsibilities
- Roles are predefined with specific permission sets
- Role assignments require manager approval

### Zero Trust Architecture
- No implicit trust in any user or system
- All access requests are authenticated and authorized
- Continuous verification of identity and context

## Break-Glass Procedures

### Emergency Access Overview
Break-glass procedures provide temporary elevated access for emergency situations where normal approval processes cannot be followed.

### Emergency Access Criteria
- **System Down**: Complete system outage requiring immediate access
- **Security Incident**: Active security breach requiring investigation
- **Data Loss**: Critical data loss requiring immediate recovery
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements mandating immediate action

### Break-Glass Request Process
```mermaid

    A[Emergency Declared] --> B[Break-Glass Request]
    B --> C[Immediate Approval]
    C --> D[Temporary Access Granted]
    D --> E[Time-Bound Session]
    E --> F[Audit Logging]
    F --> G[Post-Emergency Review]
```

1. **Emergency Declaration**: Incident commander declares emergency
2. **Request Submission**: Engineer requests break-glass access with justification
3. **Immediate Approval**: Security or engineering manager approves
4. **Access Provisioning**: Temporary elevated permissions granted
5. **Time Limits**: Access automatically expires (maximum 4 hours)
6. **Full Audit**: All actions logged and recorded
7. **Post-Review**: Incident review includes break-glass usage

### Break-Glass Access Levels

#### Level 1: Read-Only Emergency
- **Duration**: Up to 24 hours
- **Permissions**: Read access to all systems and logs
- **Approval**: Engineering manager or above
- **Use Case**: Investigation and assessment

#### Level 2: Limited Write Access
- **Duration**: Up to 4 hours
- **Permissions**: Write access to specific systems
- **Approval**: VP Engineering or CISO
- **Use Case**: Critical fixes and recovery

#### Level 3: Full Administrative Access

### Break-Glass Implementation
```bash
# Request break-glass access
curl -X POST https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/admin/break-glass \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "level": 2,
    "justification": "Database corruption during incident INC-123",
    "duration_hours": 2,
    "systems": ["database", "monitoring"]
  }'

# Response includes temporary credentials and expiration time
{
  "request_id": "bg-20241115-001",

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "user@example.com",
