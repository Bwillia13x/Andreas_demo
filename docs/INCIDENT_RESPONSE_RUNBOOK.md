# Incident Response Runbook

## Overview
This runbook provides procedures for responding to production incidents, ensuring rapid recovery and minimal impact to customers.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels
- **SEV-0 (Critical)**: Complete system outage affecting all customers
- **SEV-1 (High)**: Major functionality broken, significant customer impact
- **SEV-2 (Medium)**: Partial functionality affected, limited customer impact
- **SEV-3 (Low)**: Minor issues, no significant customer impact

### Response Times
- **SEV-0**: Immediate response, 15-minute acknowledgment
- **SEV-1**: 30-minute response, 2-hour acknowledgment
- **SEV-2**: 1-hour response, 4-hour acknowledgment
- **SEV-3**: 4-hour response, 24-hour acknowledgment

## Initial Response

### 1. Incident Detection
Incidents are detected through:
- Alerting systems (PagerDuty, monitoring dashboards)
- Customer reports via support channels
- Automated monitoring (health checks, error rates)

### 2. Incident Acknowledgment
When an incident is detected:

1. **Acknowledge the alert** in the monitoring system
2. **Create incident ticket** in incident management system
3. **Assess severity** and assign appropriate response team
4. **Notify stakeholders** via incident communication channel
5. **Update status page** if customer impact is confirmed

### 3. Initial Assessment (First 15 minutes)
Gather information:
- What is the symptom?
- When did it start?
- How widespread is the impact?
- Which components are affected?
- Recent deployments or changes?

## Investigation and Diagnosis

### Common Investigation Steps

#### 1. Check Monitoring Dashboards
```
1. Review error rates and latency graphs
2. Check database connection pools and performance
3. Examine application logs for error patterns
4. Review infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
```

#### 2. Database Issues
```bash
# Check database connectivity
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT 1;"

# Check connection pool status
curl -s http://localhost:5000/api/performance/metrics | jq '.database'

# Review recent slow queries
tail -f /var/log/postgres/postgres.log | grep -i error
```

#### 3. Application Issues
```bash
# Check application health
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/health
curl -f http://localhost:5000/readyz

# Review application logs
tail -f /var/log/application/app.log | grep -i error

# Check resource utilization
docker stats
kubectl top pods
```

#### 4. Infrastructure Issues
```bash
# Check Kubernetes cluster status
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

# Review ingress controller logs
kubectl logs -n ingress-nginx deployment/ingress-nginx-controller

# Check load balancer status
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

## Resolution Procedures

### Database Connection Issues
```
1. Check database server status
2. Verify connection pool configuration
3. Restart application pods if needed
4. Failover to read replica if available
5. Contact database administrator for server issues
```

### High Error Rates
```
1. Identify failing endpoints from metrics
2. Check application logs for root cause
3. Implement temporary mitigation (circuit breaker, rate limiting)
4. Deploy hotfix if needed
5. Roll back recent changes if suspected
```

### Performance Degradation
```
1. Check resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O)
2. Review database query performance
3. Examine cache hit rates
4. Scale resources horizontally or vertically
5. Optimize slow queries or endpoints
```

### Complete Outage
```
1. Assess infrastructure status (Kubernetes, load balancer, database)
2. Check for network connectivity issues
3. Review recent deployments or infrastructure changes
4. Execute disaster recovery procedures if needed
5. Communicate status updates every 30 minutes
```

## Recovery and Rollback

### Rollback Procedures

#### Application Rollback
```bash
# For Kubernetes deployments
kubectl rollout undo deployment/mgmt-vibe-app

# For Docker Compose
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d

# Verify rollback success
curl -f http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

#### Database Rollback
```bash
# If migration caused issues, rollback schema changes
# Note: This requires careful planning and backup restoration

# Restore from backup (if available)
pg_restore -d "$DATABASE_URL" backup_file.sql

# Or manually reverse migration steps
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f rollback_migration.sql
```

### Recovery Validation
```
1. Verify all health checks pass
2. Confirm application functionality
3. Monitor error rates return to normal
4. Validate customer-impacting features
5. Communicate recovery to stakeholders
```

## Communication

### Internal Communication
- Use incident management Slack channel (#incidents)
- Update incident ticket with findings and actions
- Keep stakeholders informed of progress

### External Communication
- Update status page (status.mgmt-vibe.com)
- Send customer notifications for SEV-0/SEV-1 incidents
- Provide regular updates during extended incidents

### Communication Templates
