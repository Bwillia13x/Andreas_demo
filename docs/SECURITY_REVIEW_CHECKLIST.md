# Security Review and Penetration Testing Checklist

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive security review checklist and penetration testing procedures required for production deployment of the mgmt-vibe platform.

## Security Assessment Phases

### Phase 1: Automated Security Scanning

#### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
```bash
# Run npm audit for Node.js dependencies
npm audit --audit-level high

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated

# Run security linter
npm run lint:security

# Scan for vulnerable dependencies
npm install -g audit-ci
audit-ci --config audit-ci.json
```

#### Container Security Scanning
```bash
# Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities
docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  aquasecurity/trivy image ghcr.io/your-org/mgmt-vibe:latest

# Check for secrets in container
docker run --rm -v /path/to/image:/image \
  zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source /image

# Validate container configuration
docker run --rm -v /path/to/dockerfile:/dockerfile \
  hadolint/hadolint:latest /dockerfile
```

#### Infrastructure as Code Security
```bash
# Check Kubernetes manifests
kube-score score k8s/*.yml

# Validate Terraform configurations
terraform validate
tflint

# Security check for CloudFormation (if used)
cfn-lint template.yml
```

### Phase 2: Application Security Testing

#### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
```bash
# Run SAST tools
npm install -g @shiftleft/scan
scan --local .

# ESLint security rules
npx eslint --config .eslintrc.security.js src/

# TypeScript security analysis
npx ts-security-check
```

#### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
```bash
# OWASP ZAP automated scan
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py \
  -t https://staging.mgmt-vibe.com \
  -r zap-report.html

# Nikto web server scanner
nikto -h https://staging.mgmt-vibe.com

# SQLMap for API endpoints
sqlmap -u "https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/api/users" \
  --batch --crawl=2
```

#### API Security Testing
```bash
# Test authentication bypass
curl -X GET https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"

# Test input validation
curl -X POST https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/api/appointments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date": "../../../../etc/passwd"}'

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -s https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/api/health &
done

# Test CORS configuration
curl -H "Origin: https://evil.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  -X OPTIONS https://api.mgmt-vibe.com/api/users
```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Security Testing

#### Network Security Testing
```bash
# Port scanning
nmap -sV -p- staging.mgmt-vibe.com

# SSL/TLS configuration testing
ssllabs-scan staging.mgmt-vibe.com
testssl.sh staging.mgmt-vibe.com

# Firewall configuration
nmap -sA staging.mgmt-vibe.com
```

#### Cloud Security Assessment
```bash
# AWS security assessment (if applicable)
scout2 --report-dir scout2-report

# Check IAM permissions
aws iam generate-credential-report
aws iam get-credential-report

# Security group analysis
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```
